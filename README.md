# Java Train Management System

## Project Overview

This Java project, as part of Java learning homework from my mentor,revolves around a train management system, covering a range of topics such as Java basics, object-oriented programming (OOP), exception handling, collections, maven, multithreading, Git version control, and log integration using Log4j.

## Key Features

### 1. Ticket Fare Calculation:
   - Calculate ticket fares based on distance, class, and type of train.
   - Implement different types of trains, including express, local, and high-speed.

### 2. Object-Oriented Concepts:
   - Apply OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
   - Develop class hierarchies with at least 10 classes, private properties, custom constructors, and appropriate getters and setters.

### 3. Exception Handling:
   - Create custom exceptions.
   - Handle exceptions using various approaches, such as try-catch blocks and try-catch with resources.

### 4. Collections and Maps:
   - Integrate collections into the hierarchy.
   - Implement a generic LinkedList.

### 5. Multithreading:
   - Create threads using the Runnable interface and the Thread class.
   - Develop a thread-safe and lazily initialized Connection Pool.

### 6. StringUtils, FileUtils, Maven, and Log4j:
   - Utilize StringUtils and FileUtils for efficient string and file manipulation.
   - Read from a file and calculate unique words using these libraries.
   - Learn debugging techniques in IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Understand Maven plugins and profiles for an enhanced build process.
   - Implement logging using Log4j. Learn how to log messages to the console and a file.

### 7. Lambda Expressions, Complex Enums, and Generics:
   - Explore lambda expressions and functions in Java to write code that is short, clear, and easy to understand.
   - Explore complex enums with additional fields, methods, and blocks.
   - Use functions from the java.util.function package in practical examples.
   - Create custom lambda functions with generics for flexible and reusable code.

### 8. Streams, Reflection, and Dynamic Behavior:
   - Dive into the powerful Streams API in Java for functional-style programming.
   - Understand terminal and non-terminal stream operations and learn to chain operations for streamlined code.
   - Gain insights into Java Reflection, inspecting and manipulating classes, methods, and fields during runtime.
   - Explore practical examples of calling methods and creating objects dynamically using reflection.
